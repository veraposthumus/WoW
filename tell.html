						<br>Tell her a story
						<br>Tell her the honest truth
						<p>
						<br>Don't be just everything she wants
						<br>Be everything she needs
						<p>
						<br>She'll tell you secrets
						<br>You'll tell her secrets too
						<br>She'll tell you all her hopes and dreames
						<br>You'll tell them too
						<p>
						<br>But don't you run away, run away
						<br>When you get tired
						<br>'Cause this will slip away, slip away
						<br>And start a fire
						<br>That can never be put out
						<p>
						<br>You tell her clearly
						<br>Speak what your heart wants you too
